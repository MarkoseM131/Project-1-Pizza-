    <h3>It all started with a burnt toast and a dream.</h3>
    <p>Back in 2012, Dominic “Dom” Verma was a college dropout with nothing but a second-hand oven, a love for carbs, and an obsession with perfecting the ultimate pizza crust. While his friends chased corporate careers, Dom spent his nights experimenting with dough recipes in his tiny apartment in Phagwara, Punjab. His first pizza? A disaster. His second? Slightly less of a disaster. By the 47th attempt, he had something magical—crispy crust, bold sauce, and cheese that could make angels weep.</p>
        <br>
<p>Word spread fast. First came the neighbors, then the local college crowd, and soon Dom’s apartment was more pizza parlor than living space. In 2014, he took the leap and opened his first official shop: Dom’s Pizza. No frills, just flavor. His motto? “No shortcuts. Just good pizza.”</p>
<br>
<p>Today, Dom’s Pizza is a local legend. From the classic Margherita to the fiery “Ludhiana Lava,” every slice tells a story of hustle, heart, and a whole lot of mozzarella. We’re still proudly independent, still obsessed with quality, and still serving up slices that make people say, “One more won’t hurt.”
Come for the pizza. Stay for the vibe. Leave with a full belly and a smile.
